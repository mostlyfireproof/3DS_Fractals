# 3DS Fractals

This program generates fractals. You can generate and view them on a 3ds.

Currently, the program can only make a Sierpinski Carpet. I'm working on more, so stay tuned!

Compiled builds can be found on the releases page of this repo.

# Requirements:

To build this, you need the devkitPro toolchain, which can be found [here.](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

# Building

* Download files

* Go to the directory

* Run `make`

* Transfer the files to your 3DS, or open them in an emulator
